# Password Hash Comparator

Hey everyone! 
This project is a personal initiative to build a password hash comparator using Python. Currently, it's a rudimentary build that supports comparison against a select few hashing algorithms like MD5 and SHA variants. The goal is to lay the foundation for a more advanced tool in the future — one that can handle a broader range of algorithms and deliver deeper insights for password security analysis. Stay tuned as this project evolves!

🧩 Features
Supports the following hash algorithms:

MD5
